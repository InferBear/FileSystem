Design

> 1. To implement `Filesystem::debug`, you will need to load the file system
>    data structures and report the **superblock** and **inodes**.
>
>       - How will you read the superblock?
>       - How will you traverse all the inodes?
>       - How will you determine all the information related to an inode?
>       - How will you determine all the blocks related to an inode?

Response.

> 2. To implement `FileSystem::format`, you will need to write the superblock
>    and clear the remaining blocks in the file system.
>
>       - What pre-condition must be true before this operation can succeed?
>       - What information must be written into the superblock?
>       - How would you clear all the remaining blocks?

Response.

> 3. To implement `FileSystem::mount`, you will need to prepare a filesystem
>    for use by reading the superblock and allocating the free block bitmap.
>
>       - What pre-condition must be true before this operation can succeed?
>       - What sanity checks must you perform?
>       - How will you record that you mounted a disk?
>       - How will you determine which blocks are free?

Response.

> 4. To implement `FileSystem::create`, you will need to locate a free inode
>    and save a new inode into the inode table.
>
>       - How will you locate a free inode?
>       - What information would you see in a new inode?
>       - How will you record this new inode?

Response.

> 5. To implement `FileSystem::remove`, you will need to locate the inode and
>    then free its associated blocks.
>
>       - How will you determine if the specified inode is valid?
>       - How will you free the direct blocks?
>       - How will you free the indirect blocks?
>       - How will you update the inode table?

Response.

> 6. To implement `FileSystem::stat`, you will need to locate the inode and
>    return its size.
>
>       - How will you determine if the specified inode is valid?
>       - How will you determine the inode's size?

Response.

> 7. To implement `FileSystem::read`, you will need to locate the inode and
>    copy data from appropriate blocks to the user-specified data buffer.
>
>       - How will you determine if the specified inode is valid?
>       - How will you determine which block to read from?
>       - How will you handle the offset?
>       - How will you copy from a block to the data buffer?

Response.

> 8. To implement `FileSystem::write`, you will need to locate the inode and
>    copy data the user-specified data buffer to data blocks in the file
>    system.
>
>       - How will you determine if the specified inode is valid?
>       - How will you determine which block to write to?
>       - How will you handle the offset?
>       - How will you know if you need a new block?
>       - How will you manage allocating a new block if you need another one?
>       - How will you copy from a block to the data buffer?
>       - How will you update the inode?
